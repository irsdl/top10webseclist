# List of Top Ten Web Hacking Techniques (as seen on TV!)

This project includes all links (not just top 10) that were listed in Top 10 Web Hacking Techniques since its begininng. Collecting this list was started by Jeremiah Grossman (@jeremiahg) and continued by James Kettle (@albinowax).

As some of these links are really old, they might not be available anymore but https://web.archive.org/ can help.
